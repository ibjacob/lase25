      <p><strong>The Light of the world - LASE'25</strong></p>
      <p>
        We witness the light shine as we start pacing<br />
        coz right from the morning tales we saw<br />
        How the light spread even in the darkest <br> hour of programme
        and even all through the reception we saw rays and smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The devil tried and even laugh and we all heard<br/>
        our ear ticled as if we were pierce, <br>how can this be
        for the son of light is being <br> mocked by this darkest light<br />
        we would have repelled but we took our stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a tale of power ~ <br />
        I am just expressing this sun of light which shone <br>
        very bright till we all laughed out our dark side<br />
        <br />
        this is not a story, it a light we all witness.
        <br>
        Kai! at a point the cloud of witness gathered <br>
        and when all was not going rossy, i thought they were witches <br>
        we could all see doubt and failure from their faces <br>
        even when ours was speaking hope and faith <br>
        This was indeed the hand of God!, we Shine!!

        As we shine, we forgot there was a morning hole.<br />
        of disappointment at the beginning of the programme
        Abi, how can say the groom was more prepared<br />
        not really prepared but suited out of preparations <br>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was truly the Lord for all the lots was brought,<br />
        None can be compared even the prepared feel contempt,<br />
        I can only say of myself, but this light truly shine<br />
        and none was able to dim it.
